## Overview

The OpenCISC processor architecture is a new design that combines the strengths of CISC (Complex Instruction Set Computing) and RISC (Reduced Instruction Set Computing) architectures. Its key innovation lies in the implementation of a distributed pipeline, where different stages of instruction processing are assigned across multiple RISC cores. Each RISC core is equipped with its own FPGA fabric, allowing for hardware acceleration of stage-specific functions and enabling successive improvements in design across OpenCISC processor generations.
